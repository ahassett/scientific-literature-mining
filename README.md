# Scientific Literature Mining

The scientific literature mining project aims to collate a collection of articles in a specific domain and extract information of interests. This project provides a web interface so that users can easily search and harvest needed information from the article repository.

## Features
* Taxonomic hierachy
* Article summary (under development)
* Experiment summary (under development)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install the following packages.

* ChemDataExtractor (https://github.com/cjcourt/cdesnowball) - chemical literature text preprocessor.
* Periodic Table (http://www.reflectometry.org/danse/docs/elements/guide/using.html) - periodic table of the elements.
* lxml (https://lxml.de/installation.html) - XML parser.
* PyMuPDF (https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) - PDF parser.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
